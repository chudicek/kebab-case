description of api available in Kebabos/Docs/Api.md

to run, rename .env.example to .env, then

```bash
cd kebab-case/Kebabos/Kebabos
dotnet run
```

the reason the api is that slow is that the db is located in us. but it is free...

this api would would deserve a fe but oh well

also auth would be nice but i found that not interesting for the purposes of this project (already did that elsewhere like a week ago; could not be bothered)

when on the topic of nice-to-have: i skipped adding common fields like `createdAt` in order to not clutter the code. should be added in the future if i want to use this for anything serious
